Methods

Average electricity consumption was derived from the Government of Canada. Average household energy consumption by housing type was then derived from Statistics Canada. 
The two were calculated together in order to derive the tonnes of CO2 equivalent produced by each housing type per year. 
This was then multiplied by the number of houses in each dissemination area and then produced into a GeoJSON, where it was mapped out.
