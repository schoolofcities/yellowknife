# Mapping Yellowknife

Urban data analytics and map-making are key tools in our understanding and planning of urban environments. They provide us with valuable insights into various phenomena such as land use, accessibility, environmental impacts, and sustainability. These insights allow for understanding how the characteristics of urban areas vary between neighbourhoods and can be crucial when making informed decisions in urban planning and policy-making.

Lots of urban research occurs in larger cities like Toronto and Montreal. The sheer scale of larger cities means more teams of data scientists, urban planners and researchers, and GIS specialists within government and research institutions who collect data and sharing research outputs relating to urban issues, such as maps and public reports. In smaller cities, like Yellowknife, less research attention does not mean that there isn't a need for similar work and outputs.

With guidance from Rebecca Alty, the Mayor of Yellowknife and School of Cities Canadian Urban Leader, we created five maps of Yellowknife each focused on different urban issues. Yellowknife is the largest community and only city in the Northwest Territories, with a population of just over 20,000 (based on the 2021 census). Each of these maps is based on publicly available data, or data that most cities would likely have readily available, and the methods are reproducable in other contexts. The first two maps are about household carbon footprint, the next two on access to green space, and the fifth on tax revenue. Each map tells a specific story of the city. The following shows each map and describes how it was created.


## Household C02 Emissions

The following map shows the GHG impact in average annual C02equivilant emissions by household - i.e. how much does each household emit per year based on their energy use. We approximated this based on a combination of data sources: 1) average annual energy use by dwelling type 2) the carbon intensity of electricity in the Northwest Territories and 3) the number of dwellings by type in each neighbourhood.

MAP

We see a clear pattern of areas closer to downtown having less of a carbon footrpint than more peripheral suburbs. This is mainly a function of dwelling type, and the fact that the larger a dwelling, the more energy is needed to heat and/or cool it, as well as the more electricity used to power appliances, lights, and other devices within the space. One way how smaller, denser housing is better for the environment.


## Commuting by Car

One limitation with the map above is it does not take into account transportation-related emissions. What is a households carbon footprint caused by how they travel (e.g. how often do they travel by car, how far do they go). While there is no comprehensive data on travel behaviour for most cities, Statistics Canada does collect and share at a neighbourhood level data on travel mode share for journey to work from their national census. i.e. how do people typically travel to work? by car, by public transit, by walking? Travel to work is a good barometer of overall environmental impact of personal transportation in an area. Overall, 73.5% of residents in Yellowknife who regularly travel to work, travel to work by car, either as a driver or as a passenger, but this varies quite a bit depending on the neighbourhood.

MAP

The patterns on this map clearly highlight how the downtown area having much lower propensity to drive compare to more suburban areas - likely because work destinations are closer and more accessible via other modes (e.g. walking). That neighbourhoods that have a mix of land-use, such as residential and employment, can lead to less distance travelled and fewer trips by car, meaning fewer emissions as well as lower potential of collisions.


## Access to Nature

Yellowknife is located in the rugged wilderness of Canada's Northwest Territories, and is surrounded by pristine lakes and dense forests.

It's partly subjective and difficult to quantitatively classify a. Some things are obvious, like a city park, but what about wooded area or
